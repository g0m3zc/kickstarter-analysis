# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project
This project leveraged crowdfunding data for insights in trends.

### Purpose
The purpose of the project was to review various factors of crowdfunding projects.  These were reviewed for any underlying trends against their individual outcomes.  By better understanding these historical examples, we might be able to set up new projects that are also successful.

## Analysis and Challenges
In this analysis we used pivot tables, filtering, and formulas.  The challenges in this example were related to the large number of rows of data.  This required us to leverage excel functionality to make sense of the trends.
